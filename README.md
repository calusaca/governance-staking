## Governance Token 

The **DelegatorFactory** is a contract that allows a governor to create a **Delegator** contract that allows it to receive governance token delegation from other users. If the **DelegatorFactory** contract is used, stakers / delegators will earn reward tokens the longer they have staked.

The **delegatorFactory** contract is based on Synthetix Liquidity Rewards contract.
